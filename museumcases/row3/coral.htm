I got the coral on the beach in Grenada in 2004 and made the piece to commemorate the 2003 elections in which the ruling party lost its monopoly (getting 8 seats) and was almost defeated by the opposition (which got 7 seats). Later I incorporated that piece into this Museum Case, adding the pile of nail people on the ground between the two houses of parliament.</i></font></p>
