        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><em>The original <strong>Circular Statements</strong> piece (8x12 feet), at right in this photograph, was built so that it could be flexibly installed at 6, 9, or 12 feet wide. This is a six foot wide version. In an attempt to work toward creating moving shadows behind the piece, I introduced an interactive element: high-intensity, hand-held flashlights with colored gels (one of which can be seen at the left of <strong>Circular Statements</strong>, in the middle of the photograph) were available so visitors could play light over the piece and create colored, moving shadows on the wall behind. </em></font></p>
