          figures for this &quot;encampment&quot; are made from hardware cloth, 
          and have a small stone suspended from string inside their chests. When 
          the figures are moved back and forth, the &quot;hearts&quot; beat in 
          their chests. The pieces for the <b>Enthnic Encampments</b> installation 
          were created during &quot;Vermont Week&quot; at the Vermont Studio Center 
          in 1999. The small figures (6-18&quot; high) were constructed of wood, 
          metal, clay, and fiber. Each &quot;encampment&quot; contained from from 
          3-8 figures with a similar morphology (their &quot;ethnicity&quot;), 
          and they were displayed in separate groupings around the wall, or in 
          long lines, as references to the refugees in the Balkans.</i></font></p>
